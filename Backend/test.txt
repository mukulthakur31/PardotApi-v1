Build me a Python script that uses the Pardot v5 Export API to audit UTM parameters for prospects. The script should do the following:

Create an Export Job

Use POST /api/v5/exports

Export the following fields:

id

email

utm_source__c

utm_medium__c

utm_campaign__c

Apply a procedure to fetch all prospects created after 2024-01-01T00:00:00-00:00.

Return the export job ID.

Poll the Export Status

Use GET /api/v5/exports/{id} in a loop until the status is "Complete".

If "Failed" or "Canceled", stop and raise an error.

Download Export Results

When complete, get the resultRefs from the export metadata.

For each result, call GET /api/v5/exports/{id}/results?fileId=<fileId> and download the CSV data.

Analyze UTM Parameters

Parse the CSV file(s).

For each prospect, check if any of the UTM fields (utm_source__c, utm_medium__c, utm_campaign__c) are missing (empty) or invalid.

Define allowed values:

utm_source__c: google, linkedin, facebook

utm_medium__c: cpc, email, social

utm_campaign__c: spring_sale, newsletter, webinar

A field is missing if blank.

A field is invalid if not in the allowed list.

Output Report

Generate a JSON report that lists all prospects with missing or invalid UTM fields.

Each record should include:

prospect_id

email

missing_fields (array)

invalid_fields (array)

Also, save the report into a CSV file named utm_audit_report.csv.
