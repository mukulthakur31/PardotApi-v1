# Security Guidelines

## Environment Variables
- **NEVER** commit `.env` files to version control
- Use `.env.example` as a template
- Generate strong random values for `SECRET_KEY`
- Rotate credentials regularly

## Production Deployment
1. Set `FLASK_DEBUG=False`
2. Use HTTPS only
3. Configure proper CORS origins
4. Use environment-specific credentials
5. Enable request rate limiting
6. Set up proper logging and monitoring

## API Security
- All endpoints require authentication
- Tokens are validated on each request
- Sensitive data is not exposed in error messages
- Input validation is performed on all user inputs

## Data Protection
- Credentials are stored securely in session
- Temporary secrets are cleared after use
- API responses don't include sensitive information
- All external API calls use HTTPS

## Monitoring
- Log all authentication attempts
- Monitor for unusual API usage patterns
- Set up alerts for failed authentication
- Regular security audits recommended
